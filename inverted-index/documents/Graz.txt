Graz (German pronunciation: [ˈɡʁaːt͡s]) is the capital of Styria and the second-largest city in Austria after Vienna.
On 1 January 2018, it had a population of 325,021 (of which 289,440 had principal residence status).[2] In 2015, the
population of the Graz larger urban zone who had principal residence status stood at 633,168.[3]

Graz has a long tradition as seat of universities: its six universities have almost 60,000 students. Its historic centre
is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.[4]

For centuries, Graz (Slovene: Gradec) was more important to Slovenes, both politically and culturally, than the capital
of Slovenia, Ljubljana, and it remains influential to this day.[5]

In 1999, Graz was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, and the site was extended in 2010 with Eggenberg
Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg). Graz was the sole Cultural Capital of Europe of 2003 and became a City of Culinary
Delights in 2008.
